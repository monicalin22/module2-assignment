			<h2>Roasted Mushrooms</h2>
			<p>Part of our Verdura and offered at dinner. This dish is rich and decadent. Our chef got his inspiration for this dish from a brunch off the coast of Italy. It boasts pancetta, a fried egg, chilies, and ricotta salatta. It is our most popular verdura. Be sure to start off your dinner at L'Artrusi with this dish. A customer favorite, and our favorite, too; it is sure to soothe your food cravings.</p>

			<h3>Pici</h3>
			<p>One of our favorite pastas offered. Also part of the dinner menu. Boasting lamb neck ragu, mint, and ricotta. The lamb neck is incredibly tender and creates quite a savory ragu. The mint adds in a bit of freshness. The ricotta adds just the right amount of creaminess. Be sure to try this out if you're in for a decadent pasta the next time you dine with us, or you'll really be missing out.</p>

			<h4>Roasted Chicken</h4>
			<p>This one beats out our roasted pork chop just barely. A chicken roasted to perfection: crispy on the outside but incredibly tender and juicy on the inside. You'll know from the second your knife attempts to cut to the moment that you take your first bite. It is prepared with hen of the woods (our favorite mushroom) and scallion, for a bit of added freshness and dimension. You'll love it!</p>
